# Cash
Program of Cash using C language and Greedy Algorithms. 

This code was made during the solving of Problem Set 1 (Harvard CS50).

To iniciatize the code, you need to insert the change owed in order to receive the output for the number of coins calculated to return your change. 

As said, this code was created using Greedy Algorithms to approach the problem presented in a way to utilize the fewest coins possible, optimizing the program. 
It cannot be ignored the fact that there is more than one way with another types of algorithms and formulas to solve this problem, but the Greedy Algorithms was the way I personally found suiting for me and my needs and knowledge at the present moment.

This code was debugged and tested beforehand but I accept and advise anyone who wants to commit changes to feel free to do so. Thanks in advance!
